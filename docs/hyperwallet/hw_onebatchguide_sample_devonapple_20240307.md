<br /><br /><br />

Integrate OneBatch to set up mapped payments to new or existing payee accounts by uploading a request file. You can use a single request file for all of the following operations:

* Register or update a payee's account.
* Register or update an external account, such as a bank or wire transfer account, for the payee to transfer their money.
* Register or update a physical or virtual prepaid card for the payee to transfer their money.
* Make a payment towards the payee account.

A merchant most often uses the following operations:

1.	Make an initial registration request and payment.
2.	Make subsequent payment requests.
3.	Update existing information.

After Hyperwallet processes the initial registration request, the payee receives an email that they can use to access the Pay Portal and complete additional fields as required.

## Supported file types

OneBatch supports XLS, XLSX, and XML file formats.

### Supported upload methods

Upload a OneBatch request file using SFTP or the Client Portal.

### Prerequisites

* You need to be authenticated to upload OneBatch requests.
* You need to be authenticated to upload OneBatch requests.
* You need to have the system privileges needed to use the Merchant Servicing Portal for relevant actions such as reviewing, approving, and processing requests.

Contact Hyperwallet Production Support at hwproductionsupport@paypal.com if you require assistance.

## Creating Request Files

Upload the payee’s initial registration information in an XLS, XLSX, or XML request file. You can also pass payment instructions in the request file. After processing the request, the system prompts payees for additional information during account activation, as specified in the program configuration.

### For XLS and XLSX

A OneBatch XLS or XLSX request file includes columns for the following types of information:

* Identifiers
* Profile
* Preferences
* External accounts
* Prepaid cards
* Payments

These types of information are described in the following section.

> **Note:** A typical OneBatch request file uses a small subset of possible column values. These columns correspond to real-world operations, such as creating a payee, adding an external account, or making a payment. This document's sample input formats and requirements follow a default program configuration. Your program configuration determines the information your request files need to include.

### Managing batch jobs

After you upload a request file, manage the batch job from the following pages in the Client Portal:

#### Using the Batch Overview page

The **Batch Overview** page shows the current overview of a job. Use this page to complete actions on the batch job, such as approve or process.

![batch-overviewpage.png](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-overviewpage.png "The batch overview screen shows the name of the file, followed by a link labelled batch step. There is a table with 6 batch steps: file upload, file approval, file schedule, file processing, download batch input file, and download batch acknowledgement. Each batch step has 5 columns. The first 4 are labelled batch step, date, user ID, and status. An unlabelled 5th column contains buttons or pulldown menus for some of the entries. The file approval step has a pulldown menu labelled approve. The  download batch input file, and download batch acknowledgement steps each have a download button. After this is a payment transactions summary table that shows information about the payment totals for each currency. This includes the currency name, amount processed, amount to be processed, amount invalid, amount failed, amount schedules, amount waiting, and the total payment amount for that currency. After this is a record summary table showing the number of records processed, records to be processed, invalid payments, failed payments, and total records. This is followed by 3 buttons labelled refresh, batch list, and batch details.")

##### Accessing the Batch Overview page

Open the **Batch Overview** page from:

* The **View Batch** button on the **Upload Batch Jobs** page, after selecting **Select File** to upload the request file.
* The **Batch Overview** option from the job-specific action button on the **Batch Job Reports** page.

##### Understanding the page

The **Batch Overview** page includes the following sections:

* **Batch Step:** Shows the different stages of the job from ingestion through completion, with buttons for relevant actions.
* **Payment Transactions:** Shows currency-specific total payment amounts in terms of processing outcomes.
* **Record Summary:** Summarizes records included in the job in terms of processing outcomes.
* **Process Summary:** Summarizes processed operations that were included in the job.

The job and its status determine which sections show up:

* The **Payment Transactions** section shows up when the job includes payments.
* The **Process Summary** section shows up after the job is processed.

See the following definitions for more details about each section of the **Batch Overview** page.

##### The Batch Step section

The **Batch Step** section includes up to 7 rows from the following list:

* **File Upload**: Shows if the request file has been uploaded.
* **File Approval**: Shows if the job has been approved.
* **File Schedule**: Shows whether the job is supposed to be processed immediately or in the future.

* **Download Batch Error Acknowledgement**: Select this option to download a file acknowledging that the request couldn't be ingested due to errors.
* **Download Response File**: Select this option to download a response file for the job.

> **Note:** The job and its status determines which rows show up. Most rows will have a relevant action button.

After selecting **Approve**, details show up in the **File Approval** row. If the request was scheduled to be processed in the future it'll be mentioned in the **File Schedule** row, and the **Process** button won't show up until then. However, if the request is scheduled to be processed immediately then the request has the `IMMEDIATE` status and the **Process** button shows up immediately.

![Batch Steps](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-batchstep.png "The batch step section screen shows a table with 6 batch steps: file upload, file approval, file schedule, file processing, download batch input file, and download batch acknowledgement. Each batch step has 5 columns. The first 4 are labelled batch step, date, user ID, and status. An unlabelled 5th column contains buttons or pulldown menus for some of the entries. The file approval step has a pulldown menu labelled approve. The  download batch input file, and download batch acknowledgement steps each have a download button.")

Cancel a job by selecting **Cancel Batch** from the **Approve** or **Process** button's dropdown menu. The **Process** button shows up on the **File Processing** row when the request is approved, immediately or at a scheduled time, as long as there are no input errors.

![Batch, Approve Button](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-approvebutton.png "A pulldown menu button labelled approve, with a popup box that says cancel batch. The popup box has an x to close the box.")

Selecting **Process** starts the batch job. Depending on the batch processing queue, a **Pause** button may show up.

The first 4 are labelled batch step, date, user ID, and status. An unlabelled 5th column contains buttons or pulldown menus for some of the entries. The file upload, approval, schedule, and processing steps are completed. The download batch input file, download batch acknowledgement, download response file, and download response error file steps each have a download button.")

> **Note:** You can select the file format while downloading. Files are downloaded to the default download folder for your browser.

#### The Payment Transactions section

The **Payment Transactions** section only shows up if the request file includes any payment records. The table shows processing outcomes by currency and job status.

Each row in the **Payment Transactions** section shows data about the payments, organized by the type of currency. The data shows up in the following columns:

* **Currency:** The 3-letter currency code
* **Processed:** The amount that was successfully processed
* **To be Processed:** The amount that is yet to be processed
* **Invalid:** The amount that couldn't be processed due to being in an incorrect request format, such as a negative amount
* **Failed:** The amount that couldn't be processed due to processing errors
* **Scheduled:** The amount cleared for processing and queued to be processed by a scheduled job
* **Waiting:** The amount cleared for processing. This money is dispensed after a registered payment method is added to the payee's account, such as a bank account or card.
* **Total:** The total payment amount for that currency, independent of the processing outcome

> **Note:** Only currencies supported by your program show up.

![Batch Payment Transactions](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-paymenttransactions.png "The payment transactions summary table shows information about the payment totals for each currency. This includes the currency name, amount processed, amount to be processed, amount invalid, amount failed, amount schedules, amount waiting, and the total payment amount for that currency.")

Payments with an incorrect amount show up in the **Invalid** column.

When the records in the **Invalid** column are resolved, the total amount that can't be processed shows up in the **Failed** column.

The amount that shows up under **Waiting** shows that:

* The corresponding payments are cleared for processing.
* The payee's account can't receive money because it doesn't have a registered payment method, such as a bank account or card.

The total payment amount scheduled to be processed in the future shows up under **Scheduled**. After processing, the **Total** amount for the job will be identical to the **Processed** amount when:

* The current date and time is equal to or later than the scheduled date and time, or the job is scheduled to be processed immediately.
* All errors are resolved.
* The payee accounts have registered payment methods.

#### The Record Summary section

The **Record Summary** section provides a summary of records included in your batch job, organized by processing status. The data shows up in the following columns:

* **Processed Records:** Number of records in the job that were processed successfully
* **To be Processed Records:** Number of records in the job that aren't processed yet
* **Failed Records:** Number of records in the job that didn't complete successfully
* **Invalid Records:** Number of records in the job that aren't valid because of incorrect request formats
* **Pending Records:** Number of records in the job that are pending approval
* **Total Records:** Total number of records in the batch job

![Batch Record Summary](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-recordsummary.png "The record summary table shows the number of records processed, records to be processed, invalid payments, failed payments, and total records.")

When there are no processing errors, the number of **Processed Records** equals the number of **Total Records**.

#### The Process Summary section

The **Process Summary** section shows up after the job has been processed. The data shows up in the following columns:

* **Processed Operations:** Number of operations that were successfully processed
* **Failed Operations:** Number of failed operations
* **Scheduled/Waiting Operations:** Number of operations that are scheduled to be processed later or awaiting payment method registration. See **Payment Transactions**.
* **Total Operations:** Total number of operations included in the job for the operation type

![Batch Process Summary](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-processsummary.png "The batch process summary shows data about processed operations, failed operations, schedule operations, waiting operations, and total operations. There are summaries for profile, bank account, prepaid card, and payments.")

Assuming all errors were resolved and no operations are scheduled or waiting, the number of **Processed Operations** for a given operation type would be equal to the number of **Total Operations** for the same kind of operation.

#### Next steps

* Select the **Batch List** button to return to your most recent job report.
* Select the **Batch Details** button to see record-level details for the job.

### Using the Batch Details page

Look up information about a batch job's status by using the **Batch Details** page.

There are pulldown fields for status and operation results. There is a text entry field for identifier. There are two buttons labelled search and reset. There is a list of payments for the batch, including the identifier, the operation results, and the status, with buttons to download each record detail. Each operation has a flag showing whether it was a success or failure. There are buttons labeled batch list and batch overview.")

#### Accessing the Batch Overview page

Open the **Batch Details** page from:

* The **Batch Details** button on the **Batch Overview** page.
* The **Batch Details** option from action button for that job on the **Batch Job Reports** page.

#### Understanding the page

By default, the page shows the batch details of all records included in the batch job. Filter the records using one or more of the following criteria:

* Record status
* The payee's unique identifier
* Operation results

The top-level rows on the **Batch Details** page show a record in the batch job that applies to a specific payee account. Expand a row to see the operations in that record. When a batch record fails before processing any of its operations, you won't be able to expand the row for that batch record.

See operation-level details by selecting the **Record Detail** button on the record row. Each payee account included in a record has a `FAILURE`, `SUCCESS`, or `PARTIAL` visual marker to highlight the overall processing results for that payee account.

> **Note:** Records can only be expanded on the **Batch Details** page if they have been processed, such as when the batch job status is `COMPLETED`. No rows show up for jobs that have the `INGESTING` status.

#### Operation outcomes

The following list defines the status options for an overall batch job:

| Job Status | Description |

The following list defines the status options for an individual record in a batch job:

| Record Status | Description |
| ---: | :--- |
| `COMPLETED` | The record was processed. |
| `PENDING` | The record is pending approval. |
| `INVALID` | The record can't be parsed due to request format issues. |

* Red cross indicates the operation wasn't successful.
* Blue clock indicates the operation is waiting because the payee account doesn't have a registered payment method and can't receive money.
* No icon indicates the operation couldn't or hasn't been processed yet. This applies to batch jobs that don't have a `COMPLETED` status.

Records that couldn't or haven't been processed don't have visual markers.

![Batch Record Detail tabs](/assets/docs/pay-portal-admin/onebatch/batch-batchrecorddetailstabs.png "The batch record detail page has 2 tabs, profile and payment. The profile tab is selected.")
