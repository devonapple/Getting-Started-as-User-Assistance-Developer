# Level 2/Level 3 processing

## What are Level 2 and 3 card payment transactions?

Card payment processing has 3 levels: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The levels differ in the amount of information required to complete the payment as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 eligible transaction. Level 1 requires less information and therefore generally incurs higher interchange fees compared to transactions processed with Level 2 and Level 3 data. Most businesses can operate at Level 1, however, when processing corporate and purchase credit cards, IC++ merchants can benefit from reduced interchange fees by providing additional transaction information called Level 2 and Level 3 data.

## Which types of card payments qualify?

Corporate and purchase credit cards are eligible for Levels 2 and 3 processing if the required information is provided. Consumer cards are only eligible for Level 1 processing.

Level 2 and Level 3 cost optimization benefits do not apply to debit cards.

## Which card networks support Level 2 and 3 processing?

Visa and Mastercard offer Levels 2 and 3 processing. American Express offers Level 2, and Discover offers only Level 1 processing.

## How does a payment qualify?

To qualify for Levels 2 and 3 processing, merchants must send the following information. However, the card network and cardholder issuing bank ultimately make the determination of whether a transaction qualifies for Level 2 or Level 3 processing:

### Level 2 data

* Card number, expiration, billing address, shipping address, and invoice number.
* Customer Code or PO number: a unique reference ID for the order.
* Tax amount: an amount must be submitted separately from the total transaction amount.

### Level 3 data

* Level 2 data, and,
* Unit amount or unit price.
* Unit of measure.
* Freight or shipping amount: the total shipping and handling charges.
* Duty amount: the total charges for any import or export duties.
* Discount amount.
* Item commodity code.
* Item description.
* Item product code.
* Item quantity.
* Unit tax amount.
* Unit discount amount.
* Ship-from ZIP code.

> **Note:** The partner, merchant, or other initiating party needs to provide the Level 2 and 3 payment details when using the [Orders v2 API](/docs/api/orders/v2/) to start a payment.

## Create Order request

This code sample shows Level 2 and 3 data in the body of a `POST` call to the [Create order](/docs/api/orders/v2/#orders_create) endpoint of the Orders v2 API. This request creates a new order and completes the payment in a single step by declaring the `intent` as `CAPTURE`:

```javascript=
curl -v -X POST https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
